# Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

# Summary of project

Startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.


# How to run the python scripts

To start the ETL pipeline, you have to run the following file below:

To fill tables via ETL:
```bash
python3 etl.py
```


# The database schema design and ETL pipeline.

In order to enable Sparkify to analyze their data, a Relational Database Schema was created, which can be filled with an ETL pipeline.

The so-called star scheme enables the company to view the user behaviour over several dimensions.
The fact table is used to store all user song activities that contain the category "NextSong". Using this table, the company can relate and analyze the dimensions users, songs, artists and time.

* **Fact Table**: songplays
* **Dimension Tables**: users, songs, artists and time.

# Dataset used

The data is queried from s3 buckets hosten at AWS

* **Song data**: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```
* **Log data**: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.
